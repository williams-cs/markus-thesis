\chapter*{Abstract}

Performing tasks that are distributed among many systems currently fail to achieve each of the goals of being reliable, easy to set up, closely resembling an existing technology, and friendly to users without distributed systems knowledge.
Because distributed systems are inherently unreliable, succeeding in these goals require the system to provide an abstraction for error handling and recovery that account for the many failure cases that may arise.
This thesis project attempts to define a set of error handling semantics that is simple to use, but powerful enough to be applied to a diverse set of use cases.
The project will also involve implementing a shell-based programming language, Dresh (standing for Distributed Reliable Easy shell), to demonstrate the usefulness of the error handling semantics as defined.
Using this language, anyone with basic shell knowledge should be able to write and run scripts that runs over multiple machines reliably.
This will greatly aid in increasing the accessibility and simplifying the process of running distributed programs in domains including systems administration and scientific computing.


\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I could not have written this thesis without the help of my advisors, Dan Barowy and Jeannie Albrecht, who have both been invaluable in guiding me along in the process. Special thanks to both Dan and Jeannie for taking me on as a thesis student during their sabbadical leaves, during a time heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

\section{Command-line Shells}
% \subsection{Basic Operation}
One of the standard ways of interacting with the UNIX operating system is through a command-line shell \cite{10.1145/361011.361061}.
The operation of the shell involves reading in lines of text typed by the user, and performing a command based on the input text.
The most basic command consists of a space-separated list of strings, with the first string being the name of the command, and the remaining strings being the arguments for the command.
The shell searches the file system for the appropriate program to run, based on the name of the command, and feeds the arguments as input to the program.
By default, the standard output of the program is displayed back to the user by the visual interface of the shell program, but indirections can modify this by transferring the output to a file or another program.
When execution completes, control is given back to the user, who can run another command line command on the shell.
Because the command line is a program itself, the shell can run itself as a program with the input being a file containing shell commands.

\section{Distributed Computing}

A distributed computing system, or a distributed system, is a computer system that consists of multiple processors one one or more machines that work together but do not directly share memory \cite{10.1145/72551.72552}.
This project in particular focuses on multicomputer distributed systems that communicate over a network that is not guaranteed to be reliable. 
As such, there may be errors or faults that occur during the operation of the system.

\subsection{Fault Tolerance in Distributed Systems}
There has been significant work in the field of fault-tolerant distributed systems, as one important goal in computer systems is to be dependable, which comes with significant challenges when in a distributed environment, compared to a program running a single process or machine \cite{10.1145/311531.311532}.
% TODO %

\subsection{Examples}
\subsubsection{MapReduce/Hadoop}
MapReduce is a distributed computation framework developed by Google to handle and process large amounts of data \cite{dean2004mapreduce}.
The data processing is done by splitting up the input into key-value pairs, applying a function in a distributed fashion on each of those value pairs, using a reduce function to combine the pairs that share a key.
In the implementation used by Google in 2004, a typical MapReduce cluster can contain hundreds or thousands of machines.
The problem of making data available to other machines is solved through the use of a distributed file system formed by the disks located at each of the machines in the cluster, which partitions the data storage to individual machines.
Because the data is stored on a particular machine, that same machine can be in charge of performing the necessary map and reduce computations.

Apache Hadoop is an open source distributed programming framework that can be used to run MapReduce-style computation on large datasets \cite{Hadoop}.
Hadoop is designed to target the use case of data processing with extremely large data sets that cannot be handled with ordinary programming techniques that depend on all of the data to be available on one machine and the work being done on a single process.
Hadoop uses a distributed filesystem in a similar manner to Google's MapReduce implementation, with explicit goals of being able to handle faults such as hardware failure, using techniques including replication to make sure that the data is stored reliably across the cluster \cite{borthakur2007hadoop}.
The fault-tolerant properties of Hadoop makes it useful in production usage, where errors are to be expected to occur when dealing with large clusters of machines.

\subsubsection{Ganglia/GEXEC}
Ganglia is a monitoring system for scalable high-performance distributed programs \cite{MASSIE2004817}.
One of the central goals of Ganglia is robustness.
Ganglia is designed to monitor failures and continue to operate in the presence of these failures, as individual failures are common in large-scale systems with high resource demands and utilization.
Types of failures as identified by Ganglia include computational, I/O, and network failures on individual machines, along with bottlenecks on a larger scale.

As a monitoring system, it is possible to use the information provided by Ganglia in an application or an application framework.
The utility GEXEC allows executing jobs of machines on a cluster, while providing data and signal forwarding on jobs between the machines \cite{gexec}.
GEXEC supports a mode of operation that utilizes Ganglia, which takes advantage of Ganglia's failure monitoring and handling features to ensure that the system is robust even on large distributed clusters.

\subsubsection{Plush}
Plush is a unified framework for managing various classes of programs to be executed in a wide variety of distributed environments \cite{10.5555/1349426.1349441}.
Like the other distributed system frameworks mentioned above, Plush has an emphasis on detection and recovery from failures through monitoring the state of the system.
Plush acts as a platform for building applications on, providing a set of abstractions and configurations to allow error recovery in a user-specified manner, designed in a fashion to be applicable to a wide range of different types of distributed programs.

\section{Distributed Command-line Shells}
The concept of command-line shells and distributed computing can be combined to form a distributed command-line shell.
A distributed shell is a shell that supports command-line shell features over a distributed cluster of machines.

\subsection{Examples}
The concept of distributed shells has been visited in the past in various forms.
However, none of these shells fully realize the goals of the Dresh shell.
In particular, unlike for many of the distributed systems mentioned above, the issue of distributed error handling and recovery is not well addressed by any of the solutions below.

\subsubsection{SSH}
One method of making an ad-hoc distributed shell is to invoke the SSH secure shell utility multiple times.
The SSH utility allows users to connect to remote machines over TCP and access the command line shell on those machines \cite{rfc4251}.
Given a command to run and a list of remote hosts, the shell can iterate over the list, invoke SSH with that remote host as an argument, run the command on the remote host, and finally collect the results back on the local machine.
Notably, this method is that it does not handle error recovery well, or guarantee reliable execution in the event of failures.

\subsubsection{DSH (Dancer's Shell)}
The DSH (Dancer's Shell) Unix program allows the user to send a shell command to all machines in a cluster defined by the user \cite{dshdancer}.
DSH uses an underlying remote execution protocol, such as SSH, for executing shell programs on remote hosts.
The command invocation occurs in a hierarchial fashion, with each node sending the command to some amount of child nodes until the program is executed on all nodes in the cluster.
For the DSH program, there does not exist the same emphasis of reliable execution and error recovery compare to this project, and it exists as a program that can be run in a shell, rather than a shell language itself.
Other similar implementations of the DSH program exist in various forms, some of them implemented with a different language or work on different platforms.

\subsubsection{Distsh}
Distsh (Distributed Command Line Interface) is an implementation of a generic distributed shell environment, with steps taken to make accessing a remote machine just like accessing a local one \cite{distsh}.
The Distsh shell language only specifies semantics for connecting to a single remote machine at a time, rather than having the unit remote machine being a cluster as is the case in DSH.
Similar to DSH, there does not exist error handling semantics to allow reliable execution and error recovery.
The paper specifies that the implementation currently only works when the machine to access is localhost, and there does not appear to have been visible progress on the project since the paper was made public.
