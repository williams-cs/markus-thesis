abstract = {In this paper we take advantage of the concepts developed for centralized module management, such as dynamic loading and unloading of modules, and show how they can be used to support the development and deployment of distributed applications. We do so through R-OSGi, a distributed middleware platform that extends the centralized, industry-standard OSGi specification to support distributed module management. To the developer, R-OSGi looks like a conventional module management tool. However, at deployment time, R-OSGi can be used to turn the application into a distributed application by simply indicating where the different modules should be deployed. At run time, R-OSGi represents distributed failures as module insertion and withdrawal operations so that the logic to deal with failures is the same as that employed to deal with dependencies among software modules. In doing so, R-OSGi greatly simplifies the development of distributed applications with no performance cost. In the paper we describe R-OSGi and several use cases. We also show with extensive experiments that R-OSGi has a performance comparable or better than that of RMI or UPnP, both commonly used distribution mechanisms with far less functionality than R-OSGi.},

abstract = {Designing and testing distributed applications is still a difficult task that requires in-depth knowledge about networking issues. Eclipse is, among other things, a powerful and widely used IDE for the development of complex applications, in particular modular applications for the OSGi framework. Our R-OSGi middleware supports the seamless distribution of OSGi applications along the boundaries of services. By combining R-OSGi with Eclipse into the R-OSGi Deployment Tool, we give developers a tool that automatically handles distribution in a transparent way and integrates the capabilities of R-OSGi into the Eclipse workflow. With this tool, building, deploying, and monitoring distributed applications is as easy as writing OSGi applications in Eclipse and using a graphical editor to visually create distributed deployments of the modules. The tool can also be used to great effect by researchers to test and benchmark distributed applications and for education purposes.},
