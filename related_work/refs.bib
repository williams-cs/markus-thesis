abstract = {In this paper we take advantage of the concepts developed for centralized module management, such as dynamic loading and unloading of modules, and show how they can be used to support the development and deployment of distributed applications. We do so through R-OSGi, a distributed middleware platform that extends the centralized, industry-standard OSGi specification to support distributed module management. To the developer, R-OSGi looks like a conventional module management tool. However, at deployment time, R-OSGi can be used to turn the application into a distributed application by simply indicating where the different modules should be deployed. At run time, R-OSGi represents distributed failures as module insertion and withdrawal operations so that the logic to deal with failures is the same as that employed to deal with dependencies among software modules. In doing so, R-OSGi greatly simplifies the development of distributed applications with no performance cost. In the paper we describe R-OSGi and several use cases. We also show with extensive experiments that R-OSGi has a performance comparable or better than that of RMI or UPnP, both commonly used distribution mechanisms with far less functionality than R-OSGi.},

abstract = {Designing and testing distributed applications is still a difficult task that requires in-depth knowledge about networking issues. Eclipse is, among other things, a powerful and widely used IDE for the development of complex applications, in particular modular applications for the OSGi framework. Our R-OSGi middleware supports the seamless distribution of OSGi applications along the boundaries of services. By combining R-OSGi with Eclipse into the R-OSGi Deployment Tool, we give developers a tool that automatically handles distribution in a transparent way and integrates the capabilities of R-OSGi into the Eclipse workflow. With this tool, building, deploying, and monitoring distributed applications is as easy as writing OSGi applications in Eclipse and using a graphical editor to visually create distributed deployments of the modules. The tool can also be used to great effect by researchers to test and benchmark distributed applications and for education purposes.},

abstract = {A description is given of the Amoeba distributed operating system, which appears to users as a centralized system but has the speed, fault tolerance, security safeguards, and flexibility required for the 1990s. The Amoeba software is based on objects. Objects are managed by server processes and named using capabilities chosen randomly from a sparse name space. Amoeba has a unique, fast file system split into two parts: the bullet service stores immutable files contiguously on the disk; the directory service gives capabilities symbolic names and handles replication and atomicity, eliminating the need for a separate transaction management system. To bridge the gap with existing systems, Amoeba has a Unix emulation facility consisting of a library of Unix system call routines that make calls to the various Amoeba server processes.},

abstract = {SSH provides secure login, file transfer, X11, and TCP/IP connections over an untrusted network. It uses cryptographic authentication, automatic session encryption, and integrity protection for transferred data. RSA is used for key exchange and authentication, and symmetric algorithms (e.g., IDEA or three-key triple-DES) for encrypting transferred data.SSH is intended as a replacement for the existing rsh, rlogin, rcp, rdist, and telnet protocols. SSH is currently (March 1996) being used at thousands of sites in at least 50 countries. Its users include top universities, research laboratories, many major corporations, and numerous smaller companies and individuals.The SSH protocol can also be used as a generic transport layer encryption mechanism, providing both host authentication and user authentication, together with privacy and integrity protection.},

abstract = {It can be painfully hard to take software that runs on one person's machine and get it to run on another machine. Online forums and mailing lists are filled with discussions of users' troubles with compiling, installing, and configuring software and their myriad of dependencies. To eliminate this dependency problem, we created a system called CDE that uses system call interposition to monitor the execution of x86-Linux programs and package up the Code, Data, and Environment required to run them on other x86-Linux machines. Creating a CDE package is completely automatic, and running programs within a package requires no installation, configuration, or root permissions. Hundreds of people in both academia and industry have used CDE to distribute software, demo prototypes, make their scientific experiments reproducible, run software natively on older Linux distributions, and deploy experiments to compute clusters.},

This paper will discuss the nature of this limitation, the functional barriers it imposes, a method by which it can be remedied, and introduces a high performance implementation based on the industry standard, OpenSSH. Additionally, the authors will introduce a method by which performance on multi-core systems is improved through the use of cipher multi-threading.},

abstract = "Ganglia is a scalable distributed monitoring system for high performance computing systems such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a hierarchical design targeted at federations of clusters. It relies on a multicast-based listen/announce protocol to monitor state within clusters and uses a tree of point-to-point connections amongst representative cluster nodes to federate clusters and aggregate their state. It leverages widely used technologies such as XML for data representation, XDR for compact, portable data transport, and RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It uses carefully engineered data structures and algorithms to achieve very low per-node overheads and high concurrency. The implementation is robust, has been ported to an extensive set of operating systems and processor architectures, and is currently in use on over 500 clusters around the world. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of Ganglia along with experience gained through real world deployments on systems of widely varying scale, configurations, and target application domains over the last two and a half years."

abstract = "Scientists, engineers, and statisticians must execute domain-specific application programs many times on large collections of file-based data. This activity requires complex orchestration and data management as data is passed to, from, and among application invocations. Distributed and parallel computing resources can accelerate such processing, but their use further increases programming complexity. The Swift parallel scripting language reduces these complexities by making file system structures accessible via language constructs and by allowing ordinary application programs to be composed into powerful parallel scripts that can efficiently utilize parallel and distributed resources. We present Swift’s implicitly parallel and deterministic programming model, which applies external applications to file collections using a functional style that abstracts and simplifies distributed parallel execution."
