abstract = {Designing and testing distributed applications is still a difficult task that requires in-depth knowledge about networking issues. Eclipse is, among other things, a powerful and widely used IDE for the development of complex applications, in particular modular applications for the OSGi framework. Our R-OSGi middleware supports the seamless distribution of OSGi applications along the boundaries of services. By combining R-OSGi with Eclipse into the R-OSGi Deployment Tool, we give developers a tool that automatically handles distribution in a transparent way and integrates the capabilities of R-OSGi into the Eclipse workflow. With this tool, building, deploying, and monitoring distributed applications is as easy as writing OSGi applications in Eclipse and using a graphical editor to visually create distributed deployments of the modules. The tool can also be used to great effect by researchers to test and benchmark distributed applications and for education purposes.},
