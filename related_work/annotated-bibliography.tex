The \rosgig, a plugin for the Eclipse IDE, builds on top of the \rosgi module system, which is a dynamically-loadable module for Java applications based on the OSGi standard~\cite{10.5555/1785080.1785082, 10.1145/1328279.1328290}.   \rosgig includes a graphical plugin for visualizing deployments as well as a deployment agent that coordinates distribution of software.  The deployment agent performs a static analysis to determine which OSGi bundles need to be deployed to which machines; users graphically interact with the tool to place modules on remote hosts.

\rosgig and \rosgi are limited to Java applications built using \rosgi bundles; futhermore, they are intended to facilitate graphical partitioning of an application to a distributed setting.

The \amoeba operating system was a UNIX-like operating system designed to completely erase the distinction between local and remote processes~\cite{10.1109/2.53354}.  However, programs must be written using the \amoeba object system in order to gain distributed capabilities, which severly limited its appeal.  The \plannine operating system, by contrast, approached distributed applications in a more lightweight fashion, by designing a form of distributed IPC modeled to appear like ordinary UNIX files, but were built on top of a distributed network protocol called \ninep~\cite{DBLP:journals/csys/PikePDFTT95}.  \plannine required modest rewrites of applications in the \plannine dialect of C.  Ironically, many of the requirements of \plannine C are now considered good programming practices in modern C.  Since \plannine, most operating systems have gained network capabilities, for example, the secure shell protocol~\cite{10.5555/1267569.1267573}, providing for a similar kind of file- and pipe-based IPC in ordinary operating systems.

\locutus has no inherent language limitations, and it is intended to automatically distribute an application wholesale to a remote host without user intervention or manual partitioning.
